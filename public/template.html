Welcome to Phrack 39.  This will be the final issue before SummerCon '92.
Details of SummerCon will appear in our special anniversary issue due late this
summer -- Phrack 40.  Rumor also has it that the next issue of Mondo 2000 will
contain some type of coverage about SummerCon as well!

Phrack has been receiving an enormous amount of mail containing questions and
comments from our readers and we really appreciate the attention, but we don't
know what to do with it all.  Phrack Loopback was created to address letters of
this sort, but in a lot of cases, the senders of the mail are not indicating if
their question is to be posted to Loopback or if they are to be identified as
the author of their question in Loopback.

Dispater has been moving all across the country over the past couple of months,
which is the primary reason for the delay in releasing this issue.  However,
now that he is settled, the fun is about to begin.  He will be responding to
your mail very soon and hopefully this will all be sorted out by issue 40.
For right now, you can enjoy a variety of special interest articles and letters
in this issue's Loopback, including "A Review of Steve Jackson Games' HACKER"
by Deluge.  Special thanks goes out to Mentor and Steve Jackson for a copy of
the game and the totally cool looking poster.  "Association of Security
Sysadmins" is my favorite!  ;)

Another problem situation that needs to be mentioned has to do with would-be
subscribers.  For some reason the "phracksub@stormking.com" account has been
receiving hundreds of requests from people who want to be added to the
subscription list.  This isn't how it works.  You must subscribe yourself, we
can't and won't do it for you.  The instructions are included later in this
file.  Up till this point we have been informing people of their error and
mailing them the instructions, but we will ignore these requests from now on.
Anyone with an intelligence level high enough to enjoy Phrack should be capable
of figuring out how to subscribe.</pre>
